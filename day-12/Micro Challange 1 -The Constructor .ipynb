    "##  What is OOP?\n",
    "\n",
    "**OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** is a programming paradigm that is based on **objects** and **classes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Class** → A blueprint or template\n",
    "* **Object** → A real instance created from that blueprint\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-Life Example\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Blueprint** → House design\n",
    "* **Object** → The actual house built using that design\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same way, a class defines how an object should look and behave, and objects are the real entities created from that definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this topic is to understand how object creation works in Python by designing a **User** blueprint where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every user starts with **`is_active = True`** by default\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that all newly created users begin in an active state.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  What is a Class?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **class** is a blueprint that defines:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What **data** an object will store\n",
    "* What **behavior** an object can perform\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, the class itself does not represent a real user. It only describes how a user *should be created*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class without objects is just a design, not a real entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  What is a Constructor (`__init__`)?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **constructor** is a special method in Python that:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Runs **automatically** when an object is created\n",
    "* Initializes the object’s **internal state**\n",
    "\n",
    "Important points about constructors:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The constructor’s name is always **`__init__`**\n",
    "* You **never call it manually**\n",
    "* Python calls it automatically after creating the object in memory\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Deep Dive: What Does the Constructor Do?\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The constructor prepares the object immediately after it is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a constructor:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The object would exist\n",
    "* But it would be an **empty shell** with no meaningful data\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor fills this empty shell with initial values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Conceptual Logic of the Constructor (OOP Mechanics)\n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor follows this idea:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A new object is created\n",
    "* That object is passed to the constructor\n",
    "* Initial attributes are assigned\n",
    "* The object becomes ready for use\n",
    "\n",
    "This process ensures consistency across all objects created from the class.\n",

    "##  What is `self`?\n",
    "\n",
    "`self` represents:\n",
    "\n",
    " **The current object being created**\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points about `self`:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It refers to the newly allocated object\n",
    "* It allows the object to store its own data\n",
    "* Each object has its own separate `self`\n",
    "\n",
    "Without `self`, an object cannot keep track of its own attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Why Is the Constructor Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Without a constructor:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The object would exist\n",
    "* But it would contain no meaningful or usable data\n",
    "\n",
    "With a constructor:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The object is immediately usable\n",
    "* Its initial state is clearly defined\n",
    "* Errors caused by missing attributes are avoided\n",
